# Statistical-Modeling


### What is this?
This is a collection of learning materials for my reference while studying UIUC STATS 425: Statistical Modeling. The content will document the topics covered in the sections described below. I will write summaries and provide examples for each module to deepen my understanding as much as possible. The examples will primarily be written in R, with some additional examples in Python if time permits.
